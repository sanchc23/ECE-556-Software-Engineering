# Microprocessor Design
Work for ECE 353: Introduction to Microprocessor Design at UW-Madison

The class consisted of one large project, split into multiple modules.

Individually built code for components to be used in the final product, such as UART, Timers, and EEPROM.

The final project we decided to make was a small Pokemon game.  

Early parts of the project were written in x86 Assembly.

Later parts were written in C.

A final demo of the product is uploaded here:
